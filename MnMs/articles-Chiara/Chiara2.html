			<h2><center>Introduction</center></h2>
			<p>Music forms an essential and integral part of many funeral rituals around the world (e.g., Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018; Caswell, 2012; Emke, 2002; Gammon, 1988; Garrido & Garrido, 2016; Kölbl, 2021; Mills, 2012; Parsons, 2012; Prelovšek, 2021). Despite its importance before, during, and after these farewell rituals (e.g. Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020; Caswell, 2012; Merrill et al., 2022; Viper et al., 2022), funeral music itself has received little systematic research attention. This is surprising, given music’s key role during the ceremony (Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020), in the experience of consolation (Hanser et al., 2016; Viper et al., 2022), and during the grieving process (Merrill et al., 2022). The present study aimed to replicate recent findings on funeral music used in <span class="placeName">the Netherlands</span>, which is characterized as lower in valence, energy, danceability, tempo, higher in acousticness, and more often in a major mode, compared to popular songs in general (Hanser et al., 2022; Mollenhorst et al., 2016). In addition, we investigate whether a similar pattern can be found for funeral music applied in <span class="placeName">Croatia</span> and <span class="placeName">the United Kingdom</span> and whether there are differences between these countries for the aforementioned values.</p>

			<h2>The Changing Nature of Funerals and Funeral Music</h2>
			<p>Over time, funeral rituals are subject to change. In addition, the functions, types, and repertoires of funeral music, which heavily depend on the region and culture one belongs to, evolve alongside it (Davidson & Garrido, 2016; Emke, 2002; Garrido & Davidson, 2016a; Garrido & Garrido, 2016). Historically, funeral rites and funeral music in (Western) European countries were strongly influenced by Christian traditions (e.g., Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018; Caswell, 2012; Davidson & Garrido, 2016; Gammon, 1988; Parsons, 2012). Funeral music mainly consisted of songs, for example, specific hymns and regional variations of the lament1 (Gammon, 1988; Kölbl, 2021; Prelovšek, 2021), sometimes accompanied by instruments, but at other times a cappella. This and the number of songs sung at a funeral depended on what religion one belonged to (Caswell, 2012; Garrido & Davidson, 2016a).</p>
			
			<p>The introduction of cremations at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries in <span class="placeName">the United Kingdom</span> and <span class="placeName">the Netherlands</span>, respectively, substantially affected the choice and use of funeral music (Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018; Parsons, 2012). Nowadays, cremations are the most common type of funeral in these countries (Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018; Parsons, 2012; Van der Smissen et al., 2019). Within the British and Dutch crematorium setting, recorded music became the standard due to its low costs, and the increased secularization gave way to a more diverse and popular repertoire, while classical and religious music remained the norm until well into the 1970s (Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018; Parsons, 2012). Initially, the choice of music was also limited due to technological restrictions. C rematoriums in <span class="placeName">the Netherlands</span>, for example, offered standard sets of typically three songs on tape that might be played during short, formal services (Bruin- Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018; Van der Smissen et al., 2019). With the development of smaller and more user-friendly sound systems and, more recently, easier (digital) access, the choice of music during a funeral has become almost limitless (see Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018, also for some additional changes that affected limitations in selection). This fits in with a global shift towards more personalized funeral rituals that, instead of abiding by religious traditions, better fit the wishes of both the deceased and/or bereaved (e.g., Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018; Caswell, 2011; Emke, 2002; Parsons, 2012).</p>
			
			<p>In contrast, the first Croatian crematorium (<span class="placeName">Zagreb</span>) was opened in the 1980s, and a second one was opened in 2021 (<span class="placeName">Osijek</span>). Because of this, it can be asserted that cremations in <span class="placeName">Croatia</span> are gaining in frequency, but are still less common than in <span class="placeName">the Netherlands</span> and <span class="placeName">the United Kingdom</span> which may also be reflected in the choice of music. The focus on personalization, and thus also the selection of music, however, also occurs in communities where cremations are less frequent (Emke, 2002). This increase in personalization can be viewed in light of a re-ritualisation of mourning in which 'the life of the deceased is celebrated’ after a period of secularization and less focus on religious traditions (e.g., Caswell, 2011, 2012; Emke, 2002; Garrido & Garrido, 2016; Parsons, 2012; Venbrux et al., 2009; also see Davidson & Garrido, 2016). Additionally, professionals who run funeral homes have become more attentive to both the personal needs and the psychological well-being of the bereaved than to conforming to tradition (Emke, 2002).</p>

			<h2>Functions of Funeral Music</h2>
			<p>Music can fulfill various functions during a funeral. These purposes are related
			to the ceremony, such as (1) background music playing while entering or leaving the
			ceremony room and (2) music in between speeches that empowers their contents or
			serves as an illustration of what is said, or music that is more focused on the deceased
			and bereaved, such as (3) the most liked music of the deceased as an expression of
			his or her identity, and (4) evoking and the control of emotions (Bruin-Mollenhorst,
			2020). A piece of music can simultaneously serve various functions during the
			ceremony. These funeral-specific purposes align with the primary psychological
			functions of music listening as identified by Schäfer and colleagues (2013), namely
			music (1) as self-awareness and as an expression of one’s identity, (2) to regulate
			emotion and mood, and (3) to bolster or express social relatedness. Since most music
			heard at Dutch funerals reflects some aspect of the individual who passed away,
			Bruin-Mollenhorst (2020) introduced the concept of the musical eulogy. By listening
			to music that is the departed’s favorite or reflects aspects of their personality,
			memory, or a specific relationship with the bereaved, those present at a funeral pay
			their respects to the deceased. These authors further argued that since most songs are
			not written explicitly with the departed in mind, for the musical eulogy, the lyrics
			and their content matter less than the complete piece of music. It may be just some
			specific sentences, words, the title, or nothing of the lyrics at all, but the music as a whole that relates to the deceased’s identity.</p>
			
			<p>The function of funeral music and its selection process extends beyond the
			funeral ceremony. Music is, for instance, one of the primary sources of consolation
			after losing a loved one (Hanser et al., 2016). Recent qualitative research further
			suggests that the process of music selection by the dying and their next of kin can be
			experienced as consoling both before and, in the case of the bereaved, after the
			funeral (Viper et al., 2022). Music is a way for the bereaved to evoke personal
			memories of and experience a feeling of staying connected with the deceased (Merrill
			et al., 2022; Viper et al., 2022). This connection is considered a continuing bond and
			may aid the bereaved in their grieving process (Klass et al., 2014; Merrill et al.,
			2022).</p>

			<h2>Funeral Music Characteristics</h2>
			<p>The choice of music matters since it is essential to reflect the departed accurately
			(Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020). However, there was, until recently, little systematic
			research on the possible distinctive features of funeral music. Traditionally, virtually
			all funeral hymns were in a minor mode, thus sounding sad (Gammon, 1988). Yet,
			as previously outlined, much of the current funeral music in both the <span class="placeName">United Kingdom</span> and the <span class="placeName">Netherlands</span> is popular music (Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2019; Caswell,
			2012; Garrido & Davidson, 2016a; Parsons, 2012). However, classical and religious
			music are still popular funeral choices in the highly secularized <span class="placeName">Netherlands</span> (Bruin-
			Mollenhorst, 2019). Australian survey data further suggests that people are inclined
			to choose positive-sounding music for their own funerals. This choice for happy over
			sad-sounding music is at least partially dependent on personality characteristics and
			age (Garrido & Davidson, 2016b). Despite more personal choices regarding music
			being made, some pieces of music remain popular as funeral music in general. This
			is probably the result of culture and tradition, the aforementioned personal factors, or aspects of the music and lyrics that make it particularly suitable for this purpose
			(Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2019).</p>
			
			<p>To investigate the properties of currently used funeral music, Mollenhorst and
			colleagues (2016) compared the playlist of a Dutch crematorium (including religious
			and classical music) to lists of popular music (Top 2000, Top 40) in the <span class="placeName">Netherlands</span>
			on valence, energy, tempo, and mode2. These investigators found that funeral music
			was lower in valence, energy, and tempo and more often in a major mode than music from popular charts and characterized it as sounding solemn, serene, and tender.
			These findings were partially replicated and expanded upon by Hanser et al. (2022),
			who reported that English and Dutch popular funeral songs are lower on Spotify
			values of valence, energy, and danceability but higher in acousticness than non-
			funeral music. Funeral music was also more often in a major mode. No significant
			differences in tempo were found.</p>
			
			<p>Listeners who are in a sad mood tend to prefer music that matches their
			disposition (Hunter et al., 2011), and (self-selected) sad music may, for example,
			help the person to cope and acknowledge their feelings of sadness and loss, and to
			experience consolation (e.g., Eerola et al., 2018; Hanser et al., 2016; Taruffi &
			Koelsch, 2014; Van den Tol & Edwards, 2013; Van den Tol, 2016). A major mode
			and fast tempo are often associated with happiness, while a minor mode and slow
			tempo are commonly related to sadness (e.g., Juslin & Laukka, 2004; Schellenberg
			& Von Scheve, 2012). Most popular music is in a major mode; however, as this broad
			genre evolved during the second half of the 20th century, its tempo decreased, and
			more songs were written in a minor mode. This decrease in tempo was largest for
			songs in a major mode. Overall, popular music became more sad sounding
			(Schellenberg & Von Scheve, 2012), with musical cues such as tempo and mode
			giving mixed messages, resulting in a more complex, mixed affect (e.g.,
			Swaminathan & Schellenberg, 2015). A slow tempo in combination with a major
			mode is often associated with music sounding tender (Juslin & Laukka, 2004). Music
			characteristics of funeral music thus suggest it sounds sad and tender, and is of mixed
			affect (Hanser et al., 2022; Mollenhorst et al., 2016).</p>
			
			<p>The question remains whether these findings on the characteristics of funeral
			music are specific to the <span class="placeName">Netherlands</span> or apply in other countries. As said, the
			selection process of funeral music is highly personal but also depends, at least to
			some extent, on culture and tradition. Funeral music may include local songs and
			theme music from popular television shows (Caswell, 2012) and may thus vary
			considerably between countries. Studies that explore potential cultural differences in
			the audio characteristics of music used for a specific purpose are still scarce, even
			though there is reason to assume such differences exist. Recent investigations on
			music streaming data reveal cultural differences in arousal levels of streamed music
			(Park et al., 2019), but a relationship with specific listening behavior or function,
			such as for a funeral, was not considered. Differences, however, also appear in
			listening to music for mood regulation. For example, the down-regulation of anger
			in East Asian cultures seems to be associated with energetic music (Liew et al.,
			2022). To the best of our knowledge, a cross-cultural comparison (here limited to
			several European countries) of funeral music characteristics is currently missing. The
			present study considers funeral music used in <span class="placeName">Croatia</span>, the <span class="placeName">Netherlands</span>, and the
			<span class="placeName">United Kingdom</span>. These countries were selected because of the dates of crematorium
			appearances and the availability of lists of music used at funerals. Previous investigations into funeral music used in the <span class="placeName">Netherlands</span> served as a starting point
			(Hanser et al., 2022; Mollenhorst et al., 2016).</p>

			<h2>The Current Study</h2>
			<p>The present study consists of two parts. First, the Spotify audio features of
			valence, energy, danceability, instrumentalness, acousticness, tempo, and mode of
			funeral music from <span class="placeName">Croatia</span> (HR), the <span class="placeName">Netherlands</span> (NL), and the <span class="placeName">United Kingdom</span>
			(UK) are individually compared to values of general popular chart music from the
			same nation. We expect findings for all countries to reflect those reported earlier in
			<span class="placeName">NL</span>: funeral music is lower in valence, energy, danceability, and tempo, higher in
			acousticness and instrumentalness, and more often in a major mode than popular
			music in general.</p>
			
			<p>Second, the aforementioned Spotify values for funeral music from <span class="placeName">HR</span>, <span class="placeName">NL</span>, and
			<span class="placeName">UK</span> are compared between countries. Differences may be present due to, for
			example, variations in funeral traditions or country-specific choices, but since this
			analysis is exploratory, we did not formulate specific hypotheses for this research
			goal. Yet, due to its geographical proximity, it is plausible that potential differences
			between <span class="placeName">NL</span> and <span class="placeName">UK</span> are more minor than those between the <span class="placeName">NL</span>/<span class="placeName">UK</span> and <span class="placeName">HR</span>.</p>

			<h2><center>Method</center></h2>
			<h2>Materials</h2>
			<h2><i>Song Selection: Funeral Music</i></h2>
			<p>The selection process was like that of previous research on funeral music in
			which online sources were consulted (Hanser et al., 2022; Mollenhorst et al., 2016).
			For a sufficiently large sample of music, information was gathered from multiple
			websites belonging to funeral homes, crematoria, funeral insurers, musicians, or
			other funeral-related services that offer help, lists of (often) used music, or examples
			of what music to use at a funeral. This resulted in selections of N = 388 Croatian
			(<span class="placeName">HR</span>), N = 500 Dutch (<span class="placeName">NL</span>), and N = 439 <span class="placeName">United Kingdom</span> (UK) pieces of, in the
			specific country, popular funeral music. These websites were accessed, and Spotify
			values were downloaded in October and November 2022, and February 2023. <span class="placeName">NL</span>
			and <span class="placeName">UK</span> websites provide lists of recorded music. Table 1 provides an overview of
			the consulted sources and Spotify playlists.</p>
			
			<p>Live music is the norm in <span class="placeName">Croatia</span>, although the use of recorded music is
			increasing, for instance, because of restrictions on live performances during the
			Covid-19 pandemic (Perinić Lewis et al., 2022). HR websites thus typically offer a
			repertoire of live music to be played at the funeral instead of the playback of pre-
			recorded music. The general idea behind these lists, whether pre-recorded or live, is
			the same: they serve as inspiration for the bereaved when they have to select the most
			appropriate music for a specific funeral.</p>
			
			<!--TABLE 1-->
			
			<!--Taggato giusto-->
			<p>Within the selection of each country, duplicate music was avoided. For example, we only included one version of Gounod’s Ave Maria, 
			even though several versions were listed. Unless a specific version of classical or religious music was mentioned, 
			we used the first suggested entry by the Spotify search. Each country had some songs listed that we could not find on 
			Spotify (<span class="placeName" id="HR">HR</span> N = 19 (5%), <span class="placeName" id="NL">NL</span> N = 22 (4%), 
			<span class="placeName" id="UK">UK</span> N = 10 (2%)) and which we thus could not account for in further analyses.</p>

			<h2><i>Song Selection: Popular Music (used for the comparison with the funeral music)</i></h2>
			<p>Number 1 hit singles from popular music charts served as comparison music, ascertaining that this music 
			is widely known within <span class="placeName" id="HR">HR</span>, <span class="placeName" id="NL">NL</span>, and the 
			<span class="placeName" id="UK">UK</span> (Table 1).
			Larger samples more accurately represent the popular music in the three countries, motivating us 
			to include all hit songs, even though this led to unequal sample sizes.
			For the <span class="placeName" id="UK">UK</span>, according to Officielcharts.com, we used number 1 
			hit singles from 1952 until late 2022 for a total of 1374 songs. Similarly, for <span class="placeName" id="NL">NL</span>, 
			we used the number 1 hit singles of the Dutch Top 40 (1965 – late 2022) for a total of 806 songs. For the Croatian selection, 
			we combined several lists (Top 40 of week 46, 2022; 73 priče o albumima; Zabavno, Antologija; and Uvijek dobre; these playlists 
			were compiled by Hrvatska diskografska udruga, which keeps track of the Croatian Top 40 since 2012 and curates playlists of older popular music; 
			and compilation albums and a playlist (1950s) by <span class="placeName" id="HR">Croatia</span> Records that are listed as HR Control in Table 1) 
			for a total of 857 songs to have a representative sample of older and some newer popular music, since we were unable to find a single source 
			of number 1 hit songs, like the top chart music from the <span class="placeName" id="UK">UK</span> and <span class="placeName" id="NL">NL</span>.</p>
			
			<h2><i>Spotify Audio Features</i></h2>
			<p>Data on audio features were collected from the Spotify website (Spotify for Developers, 2022) through 
			the Application Program Interface (API). The API was accessed through the R-package spotifyR 
			(R Core Team, 2022; Thompson et al., 2021). Information was gathered for all individual pieces of music on a track’s 
			acousticness (how acoustic a track sounds); danceability (a composite score that takes into account rhythm, beat, 
			and regularity to provide an estimate on how danceable a track is); energy (a perceptual measure on a track's arousal and intensity); 
			instrumentalness (predicts whether a track is instrumental or contains vocals); mode (whether a track is in a major (1) or minor (0) mode), 
			tempo (an estimate of the beats per minute; BPM), and lastly; valence (a perceptual measure on how positive a track sounds. 
			Lower values point towards more negatively sounding music). Apart from mode, higher values indicate an increase 
			in a specific feature. These audio features, or music characteristics, have been used before with funeral music 
			(Hanser et al., 2022). Additionally, these measures have been used to characterize dance music (Duman et al., 2022), 
			music that promotes sleep (Scarratt et al., 2023), music that is used in pain management (Howlin & Rooney, 2021); 
			and to investigate mood-regulation through music (Liew et al., 2022; Vidas et al., 2021).</p>
			
			<h2>Statistical Analyses</h2>
			<p>Analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS 28.0 and R 4.1.1. Analyses consisted of non-parametric tests, 
			due to violations of normality (Shapiro-Wilk test, all ps < .05 for all variables), and unequal selection sizes. 
			Potential differences between the funeral and popular music within each country were investigated through a series of 
			independent sample Welch’s t-tests on each of Spotify’s audio characteristics. We report the effect size of the t-tests as 
			Cohen’s d (small 0.2, medium 0.5, and large 0.8; Cohen, 1988). Findings are considered significant at p = .008 (.05/6) due to multiple 
			comparisons. The categorical value of mode was investigated through a Chi square test, and its effect size φ 
			(small .1, medium .3, and large .5; Cohen, 1988) is reported.</p>
			<p>Subsequently, Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted to compare Spotify audio features between countries. 
			Statistical differences were further explored with pairwise comparisons. The effect size is reported as ε² 
			(small .01, medium .06, and large .14; Tomczak & Tomczak, 2014). Because of multiple-comparison post-hoc testing, conservative Bonferroni 
			corrections were applied.</p>

			<h2><center>Results</center></h2>
			<h2>Music Characteristics</h2>
			<p>First, differences between the audio characteristics of funeral and popular music were explored separately for each country (see Table 2). 
			In <span class="placeName" id="HR">Croatia</span>, funeral music was significantly lower in danceability, energy, and 
			valence but higher in acousticness than popular music. After correcting for multiple testing, there was no significant difference 
			in instrumentalness or tempo. Effect sizes were medium (danceability and acousticness) to large (energy and valence). Both funeral and
			popular control songs were more often in a major mode, but funeral music was
			significantly more often in a major mode than control music χ2 = 6.16, p = .013 with
			a small effect-size of φ = .07.</p>
			<!--Taggato giusto-->
			
			<!--TABLE 2
			Note. 1) Mean values are provided for all music characteristics (SD given in parentheses) except for
			mode, 2) All music characteristics except for tempo and mode have a range from 0-1, 3) BPM = beats
			per minute, 4) Cohen’s d: small 0.2, medium 0.5, and large 0.8.-->
			
			<p>A similar pattern was found for funeral music used in the <span class="placeName">UK</span> and <span class="placeName">NL</span>. Funeral
			music was significantly lower in danceability, energy, instrumentalness, valence, and
			tempo, than popular music, while values of acousticness were higher for the funeral
			music selection. Effect sizes were again substantial except for tempo (small). For
			<span class="placeName">NL</span>, significantly more funeral than popular music was in a major mode χ2 = 24.18,
			p < .001, with a small effect of φ = .14. Similarly, the <span class="placeName">UK</span> funeral sample was
			significantly more often in a major mode than the popular music selection χ2 = 35.02,
			p < .001. This effect was also small (φ = .14). Except for tempo, differences found
			for the HR music were smaller than those found for <span class="placeName">NL</span> and <span class="placeName">UK</span> music.</p>
			
			<p>Secondly, funeral music selections were compared to one another to identify
			possible cross-cultural differences. Kruskall-Wallis tests revealed significant
			differences between countries for energy, acousticness, instrumentalness, and
			valence (see Table 3). Effects were small, except for instrumentalness, which was a
			medium effect. Subsequent pairwise comparisons revealed no significant differences
			between <span class="placeName">NL</span> and <span class="placeName">UK</span>. The Croatian sample, however, was higher in values of energy
			and valence and lower in acousticness (only for <span class="placeName">HR</span>-<span class="placeName">UK</span>) and instrumentalness than
			those belonging to <span class="placeName">NL</span> and <span class="placeName">UK</span>.</p>

			<h2><center>Discussion</center></h2>
			<p>Recent investigations into funeral music used in the <span class="placeName">Netherlands</span> (Hanser et al.,
			2022; Mollenhorst et al., 2016) showed that it is lower in valence, energy, and tempo
			but higher in acousticness compared to popular music in general. Funeral music is
			also more often in a major mode. The present study analyzed funeral music used in
			<span class="placeName">Croatia</span>, the <span class="placeName">Netherlands</span>, and the <span class="placeName">United Kingdom</span> based on the following music
			characteristics: valence, energy, danceability, acousticness, instrumentalness, tempo,
			and mode as obtained from the music streaming platform Spotify.</p>
			
			<p>Our first hypothesis was that comparing funeral music from <span class="placeName">Croatia</span> and the
			<span class="placeName">United Kingdom</span> to popular music from these countries would reveal a similar
			pattern. The present results confirm this expectation. Additionally, previous findings
			on the difference between funeral and popular music in the <span class="placeName">Netherlands</span> were
			replicated (Hanser et al., 2022; Mollenhorst et al., 2016). Moreover, effect sizes of
			these differences were substantial. The only exceptions to this pattern are
			instrumentalness and tempo (although trends are visible), which showed no
			significant difference between funeral and control music in <span class="placeName">Croatia</span>. This is likely due
			to the live repertoire in this country, as opposed to the selection of recorded music in
			the <span class="placeName">Netherlands</span> and the <span class="placeName">United Kingdom</span> which also included large orchestral works.</p>
			
			<p>The second analysis addressed possible between-country differences. Given the
			exploratory nature of this research question, we did not formulate a specific
			hypothesis, but we nevertheless anticipated minimal differences between the
			<span class="placeName">Netherlands</span> and the <span class="placeName">United Kingdom</span>. This was indeed the case. Moreover, although
			we found significant differences for the characteristics of energy, acousticness,
			instrumentalness, and valence between Croatian funeral music and that of the
			<span class="placeName">Netherlands</span> and the <span class="placeName">United Kingdom</span>, these differences were minimal at best. These
			discrepancies are likely due to the lack of (predominantly) instrumental3 pieces of
			music in the Croatian selection.</p>
			
			<p>Moreover, we analyzed fewer pieces of funeral music used in <span class="placeName">Croatia</span>, which
			may also have contributed to these minor differences. The analysis of fewer songs,
			for example, also underlies the lack of difference in tempo between funeral and
			control music reported by Hanser et al. (2022) since the tempo of popular music
			averages out to 120 BPM (see Duman et al., 2022 for a discussion). Yet, the present
			variations should also not be overstated. The pattern of differences in values between
			Croatian funeral and popular music is quite similar to that of the two other countries
			in the present work, and values for both the funeral and popular selection correspond
			to what one might expect from previous studies (see Hanser et al., 2022; Mollenhorst
			et al., 2016).</p>
			
			<p>The present findings suggest that the characterization of funeral music in <span class="placeName">NL</span> as
			sounding solemn, serene, and tender (Mollenhorst et al., 2016) extends to music used
			for this purpose in <span class="placeName">Croatia</span> and the <span class="placeName">United Kingdom</span>. Despite the sometimes very
			different tunes that range from theme songs from television or sports, music sung in
			Dutch or Croatian, and other culturally specific choices, funeral music within and
			between these countries appears to be more alike than dissimilar, at least when it
			comes to the investigated music characteristics. Additionally, all three countries are
			relatively close to one another and have been influenced by Christian traditions. This
			strong resemblance results in, for example, the presence of local versions of the hymn
			Amazing Grace (NL Waarheen, Waarvoor, HR Milost) in all three samples.
			Likewise, multiple compositions of Ave Maria were used. Research into the
			perception of (discrete and dimensional) emotions in film music between Finnish and
			Spanish also showed few and slight differences between these countries (Fuentes-
			Sánchez et al., 2021). Differences in the role of, for example, energy and arousal
			were found between cultures, but these were reported between East Asian, Latin
			American, and Western cultures (e.g., Liew et al., 2022; Park et al., 2019). In the
			present study, these variations may be absent or small at best between the
			geographically and culturally neighboring European regions.</p>
			
			<p>An alternative explanation is that music characteristics other than the ones
			provided by Spotify reveal cross-cultural differences. Analyses of what can be
			described as music show that a singular definition of what constitutes music is hard
			to find and that it depends on more factors than valence, tempo, and mode but also
			on, for example, pitch (Savage et al., 2015) or the use of specific instruments (Kölbl,
			2021).</p>
			
			<p>The present work did not consider lyrics, even though song texts are particularly
			relevant to sad-sounding and soothing music (e.g., Ali & Peynircioğlu, 2006;
			Brattico et al., 2011; Fiveash & Luck, 2016; Hanser et al., 2016; Van den Tol &
			Edwards, 2013). Hanser and colleagues (2022) found more use of second-person
			pronouns (you, yours) and future-focused words (will, shall) when comparing the
			lyrics of funeral and popular control songs. These authors reported more positive
			(e.g., love, sun, stars) than negative words in funeral music, but also more words
			expressing sadness. Funeral music lyrics are thus somewhat emotionally mixed (Swaminathan & Schellenberg, 2015). Second-person pronouns are associated with
			increased popularity and may express a social connection in which listeners think of
			someone important to them (Packard & Berger, 2020). This makes second-person
			pronouns particularly relevant to funeral music. Together with the future focus, these
			words may help the bereaved express or form continuing bonds with the deceased.
			These combinations (i.e., ‘I will always love you’) may be particularly prevalent in
			the song title or chorus, which by repetition receives much emphasis (Hanser et al.,
			2022). These parts of the text may be especially relevant to the song selection for the
			musical eulogy (Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020). Replication of these lyrical
			characteristics in English and other languages is needed because it is evident from
			previous work that music characteristics alone do not fully explain why some songs
			are popular as funeral music and others are not. Moreover, a textual analysis may
			reveal potential differences in thinking about death and mourning, for example,
			between cultures, but also between listeners with different music genre preferences.</p>
			
			<p>The increasing personalization of funerals and, thus, funeral music may lead to
			an increasingly diverse and idiosyncratic repertoire. Yet, some music is still chosen
			more often than others (Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2019). The current findings on how
			audio characteristics correspond to specific emotions and uses may explain part of
			this attraction. Personal choices involve different artists but may also have similar
			audio features. Over time, often-used funeral music may be replaced by newer, then
			popular songs, but with potentially comparable music characteristics as the present
			repertoire.</p>

			<h2>Limitations</h2>
			<p>The present study is marked by several limitations in addition to the ones
			already mentioned. First, although Spotify provides basic descriptions of what its
			music audio features mean (Spotify for Developers, 2022), how these scores are
			compiled is unclear. Several studies have, however, linked these values to
			characterize music used for a specific behavior, functions, and certain situations, such
			as pain management, funeral rituals, leisure, and mood regulation (Duman et al.,
			2022; Hanser et al., 2022; Howlin & Rooney, 2021; Liew et al., 2022; Mollenhorst
			et al., 2016; Scarratt et al., 2023; Vidas et al., 2021). Still, carefully considering
			Spotify values concerning existing databases of, for example, values for music
			valence, or different methods of extracting audio features from a piece of music is
			necessary to investigate their validity.</p>
			
			<p>Secondly, since these types of music are still commonly used during funeral
			rituals, selections of funeral music included classical, religious, and folk music, as
			listed on the websites we consulted, to form a more valid representation of the funeral
			music repertoire. These types of music are less likely to appear in the top charts of
			popular music (even though they may be widely known, see Bruin-Mollenhorst,
			2019), which may account for some differences in, for example, instrumentalness. However, differences in the other audio features, as reported in this study, correspond
			to the pattern found by Hanser and colleagues (2022), who only compared popular
			funeral music songs to controls. The inclusion of these genres thus seems to be no
			problem. Moreover, the distinction between popular, classical, and religious music
			is sometimes neglectable, consider, for example, Beyoncé’s Ave Maria. Including
			several different compilation records and playlists for Croatian popular control music
			may have introduced some bias, such as the underrepresentation of popular music
			from the 2010s. Relying on a single or more comparable lists is recommended for
			future study.</p>
			
			<p>Thirdly, the current study is archival. This means that, other than that the music
			selections are used at funerals or qualify as pop music, we cannot make inferences
			on specific circumstances or situations under which these songs were selected or any
			person’s specific traits or specific objectives (e.g., to comfort the bereaved or to
			honor of characterize the deceased) that may underly the choice for particular funeral
			music. Further qualitative and quantitative investigations should focus on personal
			preference, personality traits, song appropriateness, cultural norms, and further use
			of funeral music by the bereaved, as well as the involvement of the bereaved in the
			selection process and performance of this music. This may provide us with valuable
			information, given the substantial role of music in mourning and grief processing
			(Merrill et al., 2022).</p>

			<h2><center>Conclusion</center></h2>
			<p>The current study reproduced previous findings on the characteristics of Dutch
			funeral music. It showed that it tends to be lower in valence, energy, and tempo,
			higher in acousticness and instrumentalness, and more often in a major mode than
			popular music in general. It further demonstrated that most of this pattern also applies
			to funeral music from the <span class="placeName">United Kingdom</span> and <span class="placeName">Croatia</span> when compared to popular
			music. Moreover, differences between countries were absent or small, and are likely
			due to the applied selection method. Personal and local preferences may be
			responsible for the considerable variation in songs and artists, whereas the underlying
			music characteristics may, to a great extent, be similar. Future work should consider
			this personal choice and relevance in more detail. In addition, comparing these values
			between geographically more distant cultures seems warranted, because of potential
			differences in, for example, the use of music that is higher in energy for emotion
			regulation (see Liew et al., 2022). Further investigations should also address song
			lyrics. The present work and other recent studies that link audio features to specific
			behavior may help us understand why some music is supporting or helpful in
			particular situations, which may lead to potential interventions aimed at well-being.
			Research on funeral music, in particular, is needed given music’s importance in the
			grieving process, the formation of continuing bonds, and how to better understand
			and aid people in mourning (Merill et al., 2022; Viper et al., 2022).</p>

NOTA 1: It is beyond the scope of this article to provide a full overview of funeral music traditions
and specific outings, such as the Croatian lament. For more information see, among others,
Gammon (1988), Katić (2013), Kölbl (2021), Prelovšek (2021) and additional
ethnomusicological literature referenced in these sources.

NOTA 2: Mollenhorst et al. (2016) used Echo Nest to extract these audio features. This is owned by Spotify.

NOTA 3: For all funeral music (1327 pieces), there are negative correlations between instrumentalness
(all ps < .001) and the characteristics of danceability (-.34), energy (-.35), valence (-.28), and
tempo (-.14), and a positive correlation with acousticness (.30), which adds to our explanation
that fewer instrumental music has led to these differences in values.
